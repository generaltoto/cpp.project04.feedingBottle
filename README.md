# Feeding Bottle Manager

## More infos

This project was created using basic C++ and the SDL library for the graphical matter. 

The goal was mainly to jump back into the C++ habits and how the language actually works. It is a small project but illustrate well how to use basic SDL commands with C++. 

## App functionalities 

We implemented a view management with SDL buttons and Stock display. The application is fully working on terminal but SDL gave us a hard time. 

## What could be added easily 

A lot of functionnalities are missing but are present in the logic of the code, an SDL implentation is juste needed. 

- Add a bottle to your bottle list, which launches a timer with regarding its scheduled date. 
- Refill your stock with ingredients (milk powder and cocoa).
- Add a timer alarm when the timer expires. 
- Add a bottle state depending if the baby rejects the feeding bottle or not, if the bottle is given to the baby or not. 

A database could also be added to stock the bottles of the previous days, and make statistics about rejected bottles and average intake of milk per day.
